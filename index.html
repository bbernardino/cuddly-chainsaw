  <h1>Im so good at coding</h1>
  <p>What is the software development process:
The software development process is about creating software that not only works but works efficiently and meets the needs of the specific problem you are trying to solve. 
This process involves a series of steps where you first find the problem, find out how to solve the problem, implement this solution, check your solution carefully, 
and then continue to maintain and modify your solution. This process isn't necessarily exclusive to software however it is an essential formula if you wish to create 
a product of value.

Why is software design important:
Software design is a specific element of the process in which you plan out how you will solve a problem and what your solution will look like. This element is important 
because it directly affects how people will interact with your website. Software needs to be easy to use and a good design will be the difference between a good product 
that nobody uses and something that is widely used.

Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was
designed well and explain why:
Steam is a game platform that allows you to launch all your video games. The reason why steam has been and still is the best platform for years is because of how simple the 
design is. There is a list of your games, a search bar, and a system to favorite and sort your games. This optional customization along with the natural simplicity of the is a 
formula that I appreciate in almost every software I use. Steam is easy to use but at the same time it gives you the option to learn more about the software and customize it to 
your specific needs and this is why I personally believe it is one of the best designed softwares i've used.

  <p>Empathy is the ability to understand the feelings of others, and the elements of empathy are the factors that affect and make up these feelings.
    Emotion, the first element of empathy has a massive effect on how we feel and can even affect our actions: for example in Don Norman’s book, Emotional
    Design he outlines how a color monitor was not better for any logical reason but he refused to switch it out because emotionally, he felt it was better.
    Culture and Context are the other two elements of empathy and undoubtedly affect how we feel. Culture because of the impact society and tradition have on
    how we think and Context because people can approach the same thing very differently depending on the surrounding circumstances. The business models of 
    today fail because they assume empathy is of no importance to human behavior and therefore fail to account for these factors/elements. A popular model 
    “homo economicus” emphasizes rational thinking and sees human behavior as the result of calculated decisions. This runs into problems when you consider 
    the first element of empathy, emotion and how it can affect our actions and in some cases lead us to make decisions against rational thought. Another model
    is the “sheep” model which sees customers simply as entities or “sheep” to be manipulated and used in order to maximize profit. The problem with this method
    is that it fails to account for the product itself or the context the customers are presented with. Lying cannot overcompensate for the actual product, when
    customers discover the manipulation they will spread the news and eventually destroy your brand's image. The final business model (i'm going to talk about)
    “tasks and goals/the human factor” centers around modeling how “people” will interact with products. The problem is that this model assumes every person is
    the same and fails to account for different cultures and belief systems. This results in a product that is great for a percentage of the population but fails
    to account for the rest leading to a product that is ultimately mediocre overall.

  <p>State product: 
The original Ipod is a device that allows you to browse, play, and rate music, along with
    the ability to change volume level. The Ipod has a simple experience strategy: All your music,
    any time, anywhere. The I pod provides a solution to the large size, minimum capacity, and inconvenient
    usage of competing listening devices. The Ipod is one of only a few products that has managed to stay relevant
    and in use even decades after its invention.

  <p>Prototyping is essential to the development process because it allows developers to achieve an idea of what it will be like for users on their app without having
    to fully finish a project. “Prototyping” is the concept of simulating a finished product in order to visualize the final design and receive user feedback. Some specific
    benefits of this process are that visualizing the design can provide developers with a more objective view on how to navigate the software as a new user to the platform.
    User feedback can help in a number of ways, two specific ones being evaluating the importance of features, and finding faults in your design: developers may think certain
    features are useful just for them to go unnoticed by users and many apps and softwares today are released with design faults and problems that would have been an easy fix
    had the developers created something simple like a paper prototype. A paper prototype is a simple sketch of what the features and design flow will look like on a finished
    product, to create one you should first brainstorm features and ideas with a team, then create a sketch of your design and then brainstorm again looking for improvements
    or problems with the paper mock up.</p>
  <h1>Condimentum Consequat</h1>
  <p>The importance of communication in software design cannot be undervalued. 56 percent of all money at risk on a project is due to communication and this is mostly due to the integral role it plays in the different stages of the development process. Some integral elements of this communication are being open and listening, using proper nonverbal communication, and communicating with not only people working on the project but clients. Listening and remaining open is important because sometimes listening to others and appreciating their ideas can be more important than your own. Proper nonverbal communication is essential because nonverbal communication has a massive effect on how people perceive you and body movements along with facial expressions make up 55% of this process. Communicating correctly with clients is perhaps the most important as they are the ones who make up your demographic and can provide make or break information for your project. One specific scenario where I notice a lack of communication in general is between multiplayer video game developers and their users. Specifically clash royale as of late. I am not going to explain the game but the developers have been adding terrible pay to win updates and as a result are losing players. Long time users provide solutions and potential fixes however supercell (creators of clash royale) do not have an easy way to receive and take in this feedback and this results in delayed and flawed fixes that fail to produce results in the long term.

  <p>Accessibility is perhaps the most important principle of design because without it, your software is sure to fail. A software could have the greatest functionality in the world, but if nobody can use it, it is not an effective software. Correct application of accessibility is made up of 4 key ideas: Perceptibility which makes your software easy to read. Operability which makes your software easy to use. Simplicity which makes your software easy to understand, and forgiveness which makes your software less punishing should a client make a mistake. Accessibility is all about the client which is essential once you understand that any software is created for clients. One example of a time I noticed a lack of accessibility was during my university applications. While applying I found it difficult to read and understand the instructions, and I found it difficult to enter all the information required. Another problem was that whenever I reloaded the page all of my entered info would completely reset if I forgot to save. The page was missing absolutely every pillar of accessibility and this resulted in a number of complaints from me and my friends. On the other hand, an example of great accessibility is youtube. The reason youtube has such dominant control over social media and content in general is because of how easy it is to use. You google youtube and their algorithm automatically recommends videos based on your history. If you want something specific you can easily find it using the search bar. Youtube gets a lot of credit for things like their algorithm and format but the real secret to their success is the top notch accessibility that they provide.
